.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd [DIRECTORY]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcd\fP changes the current working directory.
.sp
If \fBDIRECTORY\fP is supplied, it will become the new directory. If no parameter is given, the contents of the \fBHOME\fP environment variable will be used.
.sp
If \fBDIRECTORY\fP is a relative path, the paths found in the \fBCDPATH\fP list will be tried as prefixes for the specified path, in addition to $PWD.
.sp
Note that the shell will attempt to change directory without requiring \fBcd\fP if the name of a directory is provided (starting with \fB\&.\fP, \fB/\fP or \fB~\fP, or ending with \fB/\fP).
.sp
Fish also ships a wrapper function around the builtin \fBcd\fP that understands \fBcd \-\fP as changing to the previous directory. See also prevd\&. This wrapper function maintains a history of the 25 most recently visited directories in the \fB$dirprev\fP and \fB$dirnext\fP global variables. If you make those universal variables your \fBcd\fP history is shared among all fish instances.
.sp
As a special case, \fBcd .\fP is equivalent to \fBcd $PWD\fP, which is useful in cases where a mountpoint has been recycled or a directory has been removed and recreated.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
command [OPTIONS] COMMANDNAME [ARGS...]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcommand\fP forces the shell to execute the program \fBCOMMANDNAME\fP and ignore any functions or builtins with the same name.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP returns all the external COMMANDNAMEs that are found in \fB$PATH\fP in the order they are found.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP, silences the output and prints nothing, setting only the exit status. Implies \fB\-\-search\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-search\fP returns the name of the external command that would be executed, or nothing if no file with the specified name could be found in the \fB$PATH\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the \fB\-s\fP option, \fBcommand\fP treats every argument as a separate command to look up and sets the exit status to 0 if any of the specified commands were found, or 1 if no commands could be found. Additionally passing a \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP option prevents any paths from being printed, like \fBtype \-q\fP, for testing only the exit status.
.sp
For basic compatibility with POSIX \fBcommand\fP, the \fB\-v\fP flag is recognized as an alias for \fB\-s\fP\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBcommand ls\fP causes fish to execute the \fBls\fP program, even if an \fBls\fP function exists.
.sp
\fBcommand \-s ls\fP returns the path to the \fBls\fP program.
.sp
\fBcommand \-q git; and command git log\fP runs \fBgit log\fP only if \fBgit\fP exists.

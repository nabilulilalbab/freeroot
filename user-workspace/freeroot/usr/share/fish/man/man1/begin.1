.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBbegin\fP is used to create a new block of code.
.sp
A block allows the introduction of a new variable scope, redirection of the input or output of a set of commands as a group, or to specify precedence when using the conditional commands like \fBand\fP\&.
.sp
The block is unconditionally executed. \fBbegin; ...; end\fP is equivalent to \fBif true; ...; end\fP\&.
.sp
\fBbegin\fP does not change the current exit status itself. After the block has completed, \fB$status\fP will be set to the status returned by the most recent command.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
The following code sets a number of variables inside of a block scope. Since the variables are set inside the block and have local scope, they will be automatically deleted when the block ends.

License: Medusa
  Medusa was once distributed under a 'free for non-commercial use'
  license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed the license to be
  identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard
  Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,
  this change just frees up the rest of the system, including the http
  server, ftp server, utilities, etc.  Medusa is therefore under the
  following license:
  ==============================
  Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and
  its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,
  provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and
  that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation, and that the name of Sam Rushing not be
  used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the
  software without specific, written prior permission.
  .
  SAM RUSHING DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE,
  INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS, IN
  NO EVENT SHALL SAM RUSHING BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS
  OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
  WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
  ==============================
  .
  Sam would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the folks who
  supported Medusa over the years by purchasing commercial licenses.
